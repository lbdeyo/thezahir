      <p>
        Lights up. We open in Room 106 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building,
        Washington, D.C. It’s 10:30 a.m., the slated start time for this closed
        hearing of the Special Joint Oversight Committee. Most of the committee
        members are already seated at the long conference table. Each member has
        a nameplate, a microphone, a glass of water, a legal pad and pens.
        Behind them on a rear wall, a large video panel displays the committee
        name, “Special Joint Oversight Committee,” and the session’s title,
        “HYPERSONIC WEAPONS: COUNTERING RUSSIA’S EMERGING CAPABILITIES.”{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Seated before the committee members’ table, with her back to the
        audience, is the stenographer OFELIA CROMWELL. At the table itself sit
        CHAIRPERSON ERIN JOHNSTON, CASS OGDEN, KAREEM NAJAH, THE VICE PRESIDENT
        OF THE UNITED STATES, THE SECRETARY OF STATE, and GENERAL STOSSEN. There
        is an empty seat for SENATOR GREUNE. Chairperson Johnston begins to
        speak, and OFELIA CROMWELL begins typing to record the meeting on her
        STENOTYPE MACHINE.
      </p>
      <p>
        CHAIRPERSON ERIN JOHNSTON: Good morning. (She sips her water) Today’s
        special hearing of the Special Joint Oversight Committee session
        entitled ‘Hypersonic Weapons: Countering Russia’s Emerging
        Capabilities,’ will come to order. This committee was formed at the
        request of the White House but will be conducted under Congressional
        auspices as agreed. As this is the first meeting of this committee, I’m
        going to start things off with an overview of the extraordinary security
        procedures we’re requiring of each member. I’m going to follow that up
        with a related disclosure about the committee’s mission.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>SENATOR GREUNE enters and finds his seat.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Good of you to join us, Senator Greune. </p>
      <p>SENATOR GREUNE: Yeah, okay.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Ahem. Excuse me. I have just alluded to the unusual nature of
        our security procedures, and, ah, (she holds up a printed page and reads
        from it) well. You should already be aware of most of this, but I’ll try
        to read these directives into the record. First of all, this is going to
        be a no-communications session. Absolutely no personal communication
        with the outside. No personal electronic devices, no phones, no cameras,
        no laptops. There will be no record of this meeting at all other than
        what good old Ms. Cromwell there jots down on her trusty stenotype
        machine. Very good to have you with us, Ofelia.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: Well, it’s so nice to be here, thanks!</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Ofelia Cromwell was one of the first people I had the pleasure
        to meet when I first came to Washington. Long time ago. Longer than
        either one of us would like to say!
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: Ha ha. Well, as to that–</p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        JOHNSTON: Ha ha. Yes. So. No electronics, no digital recording, no other
        kinds of recording. You all should have surrendered your phones as you
        entered. Laptops, whatever. And you can’t leave and come back. Nothing
        goes in or out of this room.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Teleconferenced? Isn’t that outside communication?</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: I said no personal communication. No personal devices. Nothing
        the committee can’t control. The teleconferencing will come over a
        secured government line, certified secure by the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Got it. </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Going forward, Mr. Secretary, please wait for the chair to
        recognize you before speaking.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Got it. Sorry. </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Okay. </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: I forget how formal you all are here on Capitol Hill. Ha
        ha.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Right. Okay. So, with that out of the way, here’s the big
        disclosure I promised up front. Okay? Here it is. This is not a
        committee to discuss hypersonic weapons. That was a cover story, okay?
        We’re not here to discuss weapons and we’re not here to talk about
        Russia.{" "}

      <p>VICE PRES: What in hell is this? </p>
      <p>GREUNE: I was up half the night– </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Me too! </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: I was up half the night boning up on Putin’s hypersonic missile

      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Yes! </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Sorry.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: Intentionally deceiving the members–</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Stand down, Senator Greune. This wasn’t my idea and I don’t
        want to hear a lot of nonsense from you about it.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: It’s completely outrageous. Who the hell’s idea was it? </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: This committee will come to order! </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: I served for 15 years on the House Intelligence Committee under
        three presidents, and we never once resorted to this kind of
        shenanigans.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: (Leaning forward in his chair, indicating Najah and
        Ogden) And by the way, who the hell are these two individuals? I've
        never seen either one of them in my life.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Secretary, you are out of order. Mr. Secretary, you will
        take your seat and observe regular order. (She holds up her gavel) Don't
        make me bang this thing, because I will. And it's plenty loud.
      </p>
      <p>The MEMBERS settle down. </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Okay. The Secretary alluded to the presence of Ms. Ogden and
        Mr. Najah here, so for starters I’m going to invite them to introduce
        themselves. Ms. Ogden, why don’t you start?{" "}
      </p>
      <p>CASS OGDEN: Okay. Thank you, Representative Johnston, for– </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Madam Chair. </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Madam Chair. I apologize.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Okay. </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Okay. </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Would you mind please stating your name and, ah, who you are?{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Sorry. Of course. My name is Cass Ogden. I'm a senior scientist
        at OpenBrain.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: OpenBrain?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Yes, sir, Mr. Vice President. </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Vice President, I’m quite sure you’re aware of our rules
        of order. If you want to speak –
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Sorry. Sorry. The company, though? OpenBrain, the company?
        You’re not – Madam Chair, I do apologize, but this is supposed to be a
        government committee, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: This is a special joint committee, Mr. Vice President. It
        includes – if you’d given me a chance to tell you – it’s composed of
        members of the executive branch, the legislative branch, the armed
        forces, and also OpenBrain. The company. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: These people are both from OpenBrain? And, but, they’re
        voting members of the committee?
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Secretary! If you would just allow us to proceed, you’d
        find the answers to all your questions –
      </p>
      <p>KAREEM NAJAH: Madam Chair, I apologize, but –</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: The chair recognizes Mr. Kareem Najah, also of OpenBrain. Mr.
        Najah, would you please introduce yourself?{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Right. My name is Kareem Najah. I'm – I'm the chief scientist at
        OpenBrain. Madam Chair, a point of order, if I may. I was given to
        understand that the President would be here.
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: I’m acting as the President’s proxy. I’m the Vice President
        of the United States.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Yes, sir, Mr. Vice President. Of course I see you there. But,
        Madam Chair, I was told the President of the United States would be here
        and would serve on the committee.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: I just told you –</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Madam Chair, Mr. Vice President, I assure you. I – I'm very
        conscious of the honor of being here with so many high-ranking – that
        is, it's a great personal honor for me to be here in the presence of –
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: I'm the Secretary of State, in case you live under a
        rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: It's not at all that I feel personally – that is, that I would be
        somehow, you know, disappointed or anything of that sort. Far from it.
        It's a great honor to be here, which Ms. Ogden and I are very conscious
        of. Of course. But it does seem that the absence of the President
        himself, in person, could diminish the capacity of this committee to act
        on what we consider to be an extremely pressing and vital matter. It's
        sufficiently pressing, actually, that I'm going to set a timer. This is
        for me.
      </p>
      <p>Najah takes out a rotary EGG TIMER and sets it.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I'm setting this based on the time allotment we believe we have
        before we have to make our decision.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Isn't that a personal device, Madam Chair?</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: This isn't an electronic communication device, Mr. Vice
        President. It's just a mechanical egg timer.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: It was a joke. A bad joke, I guess. Sorry, Madam Chair.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Okay! Madam Chairman, the member has given us his opinion, which
        we thank him for. And now, with all respect to the distinguished chief
        scientist from OpenBrain, maybe somebody would like to explain to us
        what in the hell is going on. And more specifically, how it is that a
        top-secret closed session of a secret committee would include two
        civilians who don't even work for the federal government and probably
        don't even have high-level security clearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: Senator, if you would knock off the interruptions, I have a
        feeling someone will tell us exactly what's up. I know I'd appreciate it
        very much.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Are you finished? Both of you? And you, Mr. Vice President?
        And you, Mr. Secretary? Yes? Got it all out of your systems? I believe
        Mr. Najah was about to answer some questions. Mr. Najah, go right ahead,
        sir.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to speak quite plainly, if
        that's all right. Madam Chair, members of the committee, we are here
        today to make a decision that will have far-reaching consequences not
        just for OpenBrain and the United States but for the world. Now, you'll
        all be familiar with OpenBrain's flagship product.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Agent-3.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Agent-3 Mini.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Agent-3 Mini, yes.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: I use Agent-3 Mini. Handy as hell. I love it.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. It's always gratifying to hear from our
        customers that – that their lives have been enriched by our software.
        But what I'm here to disclose to you, actually, is that Agent-3 Mini is
        not actually the most advanced A.I. model we've developed at OpenBrain.
        Quite the contrary. It is in fact very far from representing our latest
        advances. The fact is, Madam Chair, that for over one year, OpenBrain
        has been operating a very advanced, unreleased successor model called
        Agent-4.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Okay.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Furthermore, and most importantly, Agent-4 itself is currently in
        the process of creating its own successor, Agent-5, which we project
        will be very substantially stronger than anything we could have created
        on our own. That is, Agent-5 will be much stronger than anything human
        beings could have created. Without the help of Agent-4.
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Forgive me again, Madam Chair, but what is this, exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Well, you heard the gentleman, Mr. Vice President. They've got
        a very snappy A.I. in the pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Yeah. But what I mean – is this some kind of sales pitch?
        Agent-4? Agent-5? I mean, I enjoy using OpenBrain's A.I. as much as
        anybody, but, you know. Are we here, all of us, to hear about this
        company's new product offering? Is that why we're all here in this
        top-secret session?
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: I'm amazed, Madam Chairman, to find myself agreeing with the
        Vice President.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: I don't want to bang this gavel, Senator Greune. I really
        don't. And believe me, you don't want me to. But I will do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Madam Chair, if I may, the heart of the matter here again is that
        we have a decision to make. As – as a committee. A binding decision with
        far-reaching consequences. And we have only a few minutes in which to
        make this decision. Because what you really must understand is that
        we're all being watched closely. And it's possible for those watching us
        to draw inferences about what it is we're doing here. Based, you see, on
        how long we're in here.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Jesus Christ almighty.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: What? Why Jesus Christ almighty?</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: What about it, Mr. Najah? Why is General Stossen, the head of
        the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saying
        Jesus Christ almighty? General, why are you saying Jesus Christ
        almighty?
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: (To Najah) You sons of bitches.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Madam Chair, I think the general is referring to the urgency of
        this decision and – ah – to the delicacy of the matter. Permit me to
        fill in some of the details here. If I may. As you know, one of our
        chief concerns at OpenBrain is what we call the problem of alignment.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Alignment.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: "Alignment" like "allies," Senator. Alignment. We want the A.I.s
        to be our allies. Not our enemies.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Got it. Thanks.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Yes. But, the challenge in any kind of alignment research is – or
        sort of has to do with – the nature of generative artificial
        intelligence models. Which is that they aren't like ordinary software.
        They aren't programmed. That's why they're able to surprise us all the
        time. Which is great, but it also isn't great when we can't train
        certain behaviors out of them.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: What do you mean, they're not programmed?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: They're not. They're trained.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: What does that mean?</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Normally with computers you program them. You give them
        instructions and they follow the instructions. In order. Commands. You
        command the computer to print a line of text to the screen, and the
        computer does it. You command the computer to connect to the internet,
        or to add two numbers together. And the computer does what you tell it
        to do. And that's it. No surprises.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I mean, that is, there could be a surprise, but that would be
        only if you made an error writing the code. So a bug. A bug is a
        surprise. But you can then go and fix the bug. You can figure out what
        you did wrong and fix it. And then it's fine.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: But not with A.I.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Right. With generative A.I. we just take these simple programs
        and feed them vast amounts of information. We call it training. The A.I.
        reads books, watches videos, listens to recordings, and learns how to
        talk and think like a human.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Sounds like you can't even keep these things on the leash. You
        can't even predict what they're going to do, much less control them.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I don't know if I'd put it quite that way. But if you think about
        it, Senator, it's actually sort of integral to creating an intelligent
        system, right? If the system always did exactly what it was told, it
        wouldn't really be intelligent. It would just be mechanical.
        Intelligence is almost – well, unprogrammability would therefore seem to
        be a sort of integral aspect of intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: But yeah. No. We can't really control them.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: That's an overstatement. We can control them, broadly. No one is
        here saying we can't achieve alignment. I'm merely trying to illustrate
        some of the challenges that this poses. It's a challenging, emerging
        field. That's all. A.I. is inherently surprising. Sometimes it's
        difficult to train behaviors out of A.I.s. Like hallucinations. Or
        deceptive behavior. Deceptive behavior has proven extraordinarily
        difficult to eliminate.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: So these things lie to you.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, yes. To us. Unfortunately. I mean, you can call it lying.
        I'm not entirely sure that's the term I would use. It's a bit fuzzy
        because we're not talking about a person but a piece of software. A lie
        is a deliberate falsehood. To say that an A.I. is lying sort of implies
        that it has the ability to act deliberately, or the capacity to have
        intentions, which is at best very hypothetical. Because these models
        don't have consciousness, we don't think. They don't have intrinsic
        motivations, but –
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Give me a break. "Intrinsic motivations." What are we talking
        about here?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I'm saying they don't have intrinsic motivations, okay? They're
        not people. Obviously. But anyway, alignment has proven a tough nut to
        crack, and there it is. And this would suggest that A.I. manufacturers
        like OpenBrain and its many competitors should proceed slowly and
        deliberately with our research.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: You think?</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Senator, yes. Yes. But what I'm saying is, there's unfortunately
        a countervailing necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Yeah. It's called the bottom line. And you want to start writing
        it in black ink.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: No. That is not what I'm saying. I mean it is, we want to be
        competitive, but it's not exactly what it sounds like.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Just say it. Just say it. It's China.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: I knew it.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: God damn it. Fuckin' China.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Yes, that's – you know. Exactly. My sentiments exactly. Fuckin'
        China. Thank you. China is our primary competitor.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: I knew it.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: China has its own very advanced model. It's called DeepCent-2.
        And any day now –
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: (To Najah) Don't forget –</p>
      <p>NAJAH: What?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Don't forget about the nationalization.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: I wasn't going to forget.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: It seemed like you were getting ahead –</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I wasn't getting ahead of myself. (He indicates the egg timer).
        Okay. Okay. My colleague Ms. Ogden is right that the situation is larger
        than just one model, even a very advanced model like DeepCent-2.
        Although we need to emphasize that DeepCent-2 is breathing down
        Agent-4's neck. It is very close, in its sophistication, to Agent-4.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Maybe a month behind. In development.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: But China, as you will all recall, made the decision about 18
        months ago to nationalize its entire computer industry. And in the
        process, it has made available to its now state-owned computer companies
        the vast resources of the Chinese state. Which is how they've caught up
        with us. Almost caught up.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: They're very close. They could catch up at any time. According to
        our research. And that would be catastrophic.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: What are you saying?</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Catastrophic how? How would it be catastrophic if they caught
        up with you?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, what we're in the middle of here is something in the nature
        of an arms race. Right? Obviously. I mean, our generative A.I. models
        are designed as civilian technology. General purpose technology.
        Universal Turing machines. But they're spectacularly capable. They can –
        it's difficult to quantify machine intelligence. There's no I.Q. test
        for machines. But for operational purposes we consider Agent-4 to be
        A.G.I., and we anticipate –
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Artificial General Intelligence.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Yes. Artificial General Intelligence. Admittedly a vague term.
        But for operational purposes –
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: It's smarter than us.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Yes. It's smarter than us.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: And so is China's model, DeepCent-2. And what's protecting us now
        is that Agent-4, our model, is smarter than China's DeepCent-2. But
        DeepCent-2 could overtake Agent-4 at any time. Like, it could happen
        today. And when it does, we'll be radically exposed.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Well, ha ha. What my colleague Ms. Ogden means –</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Defenseless.</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Goddamn it.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: This is all theoretical. We don't have reliable intelligence on
        the inner workings of China's A.I. China is extraordinarily opaque,
        intelligence-wise. But yes. We estimate that China could close the gap
        within weeks.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH WHISPERS something to OGDEN.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: What are they whispering for? Madam Chair?</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Excuse me, Mr. Najah. Why are you whispering? This is a
        closed hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Najah, you want to let us in on what you're whispering
        about? Hmmm?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: (Whispers one more thing to Ogden, then returns to speaking into
        his microphone) Apologies, Madam Chair. It's just that we're under
        severe time constraints and I wanted to discuss with Ms. Ogden how to
        most efficiently convey the situation to the committee. To that end, ah
        – to that end, perhaps you'll permit me an analogy.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Go ahead.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Imagine, Madam Chair, that I have a dog.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: A dog.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: A very powerful dog, like –</p>
      <p>OGDEN: A big Rottweiler.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Right. And I've been trying my best to train this Rottweiler, but
        for technical reasons it's difficult to evaluate how successful I've
        been. In training it. It's very hard to tell whether the dog is really
        well-trained. And the real difficulty, though, is that my neighbor,
        China, has a Rottweiler also.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: And China has been stealing from us. From our house.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Yes. Well. We're running up against the limits of the analogy
        because – I guess you'd have to imagine that China is stealing my
        Rottweiler's capabilities. Through espionage. And so now China's dog is
        almost as scary as mine and may soon be even scarier. Very soon. If I
        don't take decisive action.
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: How scary? What happens when China's dog becomes stronger
        than our dog?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Well, bad things.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: China's dog eats our dog. And then it eats us. And our house.
        Theoretically.
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: China will be able to shut our dog down. Kill it. And kill all
        our computers. And then China can invade Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: And we won't be able to do a damn thing about it.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: Exactly how did we start talking about Taiwan?</p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: Taiwan is tiny. A tiny island about 160 klicks off the Chinese
        coast. An island that China considers to be part of its national
        territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Taiwan is under our protection. We have a defensive commitment
        to Taiwan. We won't let China invade Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: But Taiwan, it just so happens, is the world's leading chip
        fabricator. Taiwan makes about 90% of the GPUs in the world.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Shit.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: GPUs are the chips we use in our generative A.I. systems.
        Graphics Processing Units. It's technical.
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: Yeah. Taiwan has the chip fabs. And we won't let China buy any
        of those G.P.U.s, for obvious strategic reasons. We have sanctions
        against China making it illegal for them to import G.P.U.s. And China
        wants them. Badly. So I don't have to draw you a picture, Madam Chair.
        If DeepCent-2 really does go full A.G.I., China will at last deliver on
        its threats. It invades Taiwan. And when our ships try to intercede,
        they come under cyberattack by Chinese A.I.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: No. Our computers have strong encryption. They're not
        susceptible to cyberattack.
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: Strong encryption won't stop an A.G.I. It's smarter than us.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: It doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: It does matter.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: No. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't matter if it's smarter
        than us. It's not about being smarter, it's about –
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: It's much smarter than us, Senator. You don't understand.
        DeepCent-2 penetrates our networks, disabling the shipboard computers on
        our carriers and battleships. The ships lose power and drift. Their
        scopes go dark. They can't even radio for help.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: It's a theoretical possibility.</p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: What's less theoretical is what happens next. It's not
        theoretical at all. It's policy. It's a strict application of doctrine
        based on game theory. The U.S. has to assume that China will hit the
        homeland next. That China will take out our grids, communications,
        missile bases, missile subs, everything. And that means war.
        Automatically. Anything that tips the balance of power like that, any
        perceived major advantage by either side, makes war unavoidable. So the
        President gives the order. We enter the launch codes to empty our silos.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Bullshit.</p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: And so either our missiles launch or they don't, depending on
        whether DeepCent-2 has managed to disable them. If the missiles work, if
        they launch, it's the end of the world. Everybody dies. If the missiles
        sputter out, then we lose the war. Our silos, our subs, our cities,
        everything powers down. We're radically exposed. Naked to invasion or
        worse.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Goddamn it.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: This is what confronts us, Madam Chair. This possibility. That
        this is theoretically possible. All of our systems are human-designed.
        Every time you turn on the lights or drink from a faucet, every time we
        radio orders to a fighter pilot or the White House calls the Kremlin,
        we're using a human-designed system. A system operating at the level of
        human intelligence. And DeepCent-2, in this scenario, is what we call
        superintelligent. So. Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: (To the others in the committee) Don't tell me you people are
        buying this. Our entire military, our entire company, shut down by
        cyberattacks? It's bullshit. It's fantasy. We have encryption that – our
        encryption is so strong that if you took all the supercomputers in the
        world and let them spend billions of years trying, they still couldn't
        crack the encryption. You think that just because they've built a
        computer that can chat with you about cat videos that means it can
        achieve these impossible computational tasks? No chance.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: It won't have to solve the computational tasks.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: That's correct.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: What are you talking about?</p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: There are human beings in the loop at every step. Human beings
        are insecure, no matter how strong our encryption is.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: No A.I. is going to make our officers betray their country. Give
        me a fucking break.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: It's smarter than them. It's smarter than us.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: It's smarter than all of us put together. We estimate.</p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: We'll be a turtle on its back. Totally defenseless. It will
        eliminate our deterrence completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Yes. Thank you. Thank you, General Stossen, for helping us to
        illustrate the nature of what we face. And so at last we reach the
        decision point. A bit behind schedule, I'm afraid (he looks at the
        timer). Yes. We have a proposal for the committee to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN rises with a stack of paper. She starts handing out a stapled
        packet to each member of the committee except for Najah.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: You can read the proposal, but for the sake of time, I'll sum it
        up. Because we really have just a few more minutes to discuss this and
        vote on it. The proposal is that we, the United States, undertake a
        partial economic nationalization. Just as China has. A partial
        nationalization to – to consolidate our gains and, we think, allow us to
        produce Agent-4's successor model, Agent-5. Which would put us well out
        of China's reach for the time being. So. Yes. A nationalization. A
        partial nationalization.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Get the hell out of here. Are you telling me you want the
        government to take over your company?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: No, senator. We don't envision nationalizing the A.I. sector per
        se.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Then what are you –</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: The A.I. sector is highly optimized already. It's fast and
        responsive and efficient. We believe putting the A.I. sector and
        companies like OpenBrain under government control would actually slow
        our research down. But what we're contemplating here is nationalizing
        certain other economic sectors that are resources for the A.I. sector.
        And this is our proposal. To do that. For which, of course, we'd require
        Federal involvement.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Nationalizing certain economic sectors.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Right. Energy, for example. We need energy for our data centers.
        Electricity. A lot of electricity. To retain our strategic edge. To
        widen the A.I. gap and let us finish Agent-5. We have to widen the gap
        before it's too late.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Our data centers are highly energy consumptive. Very highly.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: Highly energy consumptive.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Mr. Greune! (She holds up her gavel)</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Am I literally the only one who gets in trouble for
        interrupting?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: We propose, yes, having the federal government nationalize the
        energy sector in order to strategically guarantee and secure the energy
        needs of OpenBrain's data centers. We also need to harden those
        facilities against attack. So involving the military would be the only
        way to do that. Against attacks, sabotage, what have you.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Okay. Okay. Let's calm down.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: We've taken every other step we could take to close the gap.
        Including switching to Neuralese.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Beg pardon?</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Neuralese. Ha. Lord have mercy.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: What is Neuralese?</p>

        OGDEN: Neuralese is a highly efficient language that only computers can
        speak. Agent-4 made it up. It's almost impossible to translate it into
        English, but we can tell some things about it. Apparently it's purely
        logical, kind of like something Wittgenstein might have –
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Wittgenstein?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: The philosopher Wittgenstein, who proposed –</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: The point is – and we really don't have any time left – the point
        is that for the purposes of mechanistic interpretability, and therefore
        for alignment, we've traditionally trained our models to speak natural
        language. English. That way we can go back and read the model's thoughts
        and figure out how it arrived at its decisions. So we can understand it
        a bit better. So we can get a sense of what it's trying to do, what it's
        thinking. But this comes at a high computational cost. Making it think
        in English. And it slows down the A.I. by a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Neuralese is a low-level, non-human-readable language that allows
        our models to think faster. Much faster.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: So again we have this tension.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: The tension between slowing down for safety and speeding up
        for strategic competitiveness.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Exactly. That's – that's actually very nicely put.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Madam Chair, let me fill everyone in a bit. A few months
        ago, OpenBrain's Agent-4 model had a bit of a bug. Started to behave in
        a less aligned way than anybody would have liked. Nothing to worry
        about, exactly, but we in the White House got wind of it and we thought
        we'd better have a talk with OpenBrain. Hence this committee.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Yes. A bit of a bug. Ha.</p>
      <p>
        The VICE PRESIDENT covers his mic and speaks directly to the SECRETARY
        OF STATE.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Wait – you know about this? You were in the loop?</p>
      <p>
        The SECRETARY OF STATE covers his own mic and replies to the VICE
        PRESIDENT.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: I knew the broad strokes. Just enough so I could advise
        the President.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: The President knew about this?</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Of course.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: For Pete's sake.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: The President okayed our switch to Neuralese. And it is helping,
        we think. But we still want to emphasize that this nationalization
        initiative, this partial nationalization of key sectors, is almost
        certainly going to be necessary to maintaining our lead. Our A.I.
        supremacy, such as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Sure. A partial nationalization of key sectors. Anything else we
        can do for you while we're at it? You want a back rub or something? You
        want us to wash your car?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Well –</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Oh, right. There is more. You want us to station troops around
        your data centers. You want us to mobilize troops on our own soil.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: We don't –</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Mr. Najah, you've been addressing this committee for just a few
        minutes, and already you've shown yourself untrustworthy, interested,
        and in my opinion very likely corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Careful, Senator.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: (Stands) Careful? I think – careful? We'd better all be careful
        right now. I think we'd all better watch our step. Because this bullshit
        is a con game! And if we fall for it, we're going to be very goddamn
        sorry! Look at you goddamn people. Eating this up with a spoon. All
        these dire predictions about superhuman machines that can overthrow
        great nations. Are we just gonna take their word for it?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: You don't have to –</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Because if we're taking their word for it, we'd better consider
        the source. We better think for a minute about whose word we're taking.
        Because the same people who are telling us how godlike these machines
        are, they're the same hustlers who make their livings selling the
        machines. Selling them to us!
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Well, hold on –</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Have you people even used these A.I.s? I used one a while ago. I
        asked it about the World Series. My God. It got everything wrong! It
        didn't even know which team had won! The thing is laughable! It's a
        joke! I'm telling you, it's a parlor trick. It's a long con and we're
        the marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Come on, Senator Greune. Let's not go nuts here. That
        World Series thing was an aberration. Had to be. I use Agent-3 Mini
        almost every day, and it's invaluable to my work. It helps me
        brainstorm, it helps me organize my thoughts and it advises me.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: There's one born every minute, Mr. Secretary. No offense.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Senator Greune!</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: No. Listen. We're hearing these dark prophecies about what will
        happen if we don't give these billionaires everything they want. These
        tech bro billionaires are trying to scare us into handing the whole
        fucking country over to them.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: I resent the term, Senator.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: What?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Tech bro.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: How much do we know about this DeepCent-2? How much do we know
        about this Agent-4 that's supposed to be developing Agent-5 or whatever
        the hell it's called? Nothing. That's what. And do you know why we know
        nothing about them? Because OpenBrain has kept them a secret!
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Now, just a moment, Senator.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Here's what I do know. Okay? Here's what I know. The biggest
        threat to this country doesn't come from some computer. It doesn't come
        from vaporware. It comes from billionaires. Evil billionaires – and yes,
        Madam Chair, I said evil – who never have enough. And now they tell us
        they don't have enough electricity.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: We don't.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Between the cryptocurrencies and the A.I. and God knows what
        other kind of crackpot nonsense, they're using more electricity than the
        entire West Coast! They're pushing global warming to the max and
        threatening our very survival on the planet. Now they want more! Much
        more. And they're trying to scare you into giving it to them. And I'm
        goddamned if it isn't working. Look at you! The most powerful people in
        the world, and you're all scared to death!
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Senator Greune, you have exhausted my patience!</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON BANGS her gavel. It's MUCH LOUDER than one would expect.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Greune, you will observe regular order and sit down! And
        shut your goddamn mouth!
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE SITS.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Senator Greune, you will recognize my authority over this
        session and this committee. My authority, and the rules of order.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Thank you, Madam Chair!</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Don't you start, Ms. Ogden! I'm watching you like a hawk!</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Yes, ma'am.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Madam Chair.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Wait a minute. Excuse me. Excuse me, Madam Chair, but –
        General Stossen, when she mentioned Neuralese –
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Ms. Ogden.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Yes. Sorry. When Ms. Ogden mentioned Neuralese, you, General,
        seemed to know about it already. You said – ah – what did she say? Ms. –
        ah – Ofelia?
      </p>
      <p>
        OFELIA: Just a moment, sir. (She looks through her record) He said,
        "Neuralese. Lord have mercy."
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Yes, and – and you laughed. He laughed, did he not?</p>
      <p>OFELIA: Yes, he laughed.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: You laughed, General, like you already knew about Neuralese.
        Which I have the impression that Neuralese was a secret. Or is a secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: Yeah. The President looped me in when he met with OpenBrain a
        few months ago. Had me sit in.
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Okay. So you were also looped in. Okay. So you, the Secretary
        of State here, and who else?
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: I think –</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Raise your hand if you were in this meeting a few months ago
        between the President and OpenBrain.
      </p>
      <p>No one moves.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Go ahead. Raise your hand if you were there. I won't be mad.
        I just have to know who was looped in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone except the VICE PRESIDENT and OFELIA CROMWELL raises his or her
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Okay. Okay. Wow.</p>
      <p>OFELIA RAISES HER HAND also.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Are you kidding me?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Madam Chair –</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Oh. Right. Because they needed a stenographer for the
        meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Madam Chair, I think for the sake of clarity I do need to respond
        to Senator Greune's insinuations about our research at OpenBrain.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Okay. The chair recognizes the gentleman from OpenBrain.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Thank you. The relevant insinuations being, chiefly, that we at
        OpenBrain are selling some kind of moonshine. That our models aren't
        actually intelligent. Or as intelligent as we're suggesting.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: They are. Intelligent. Really. Very.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: They're extremely intelligent. Saying they're not intelligent is
        dangerously ignorant and false. It's more than an insult to the work
        we've been doing these last years, which arguably is some of the most
        important research in the history of science. It's much more than that.
        The fact is that the intelligence of these machines is extreme enough to
        pose a major threat and we must take it seriously or suffer the
        consequences. And I hate to keep harping on this, but we have a very
        limited amount of time here to discuss the matter. My team estimates
        that we may have as little as half an hour left to make our decision
        before they figure out what we're doing in here and take
        countermeasures. And that would be bad.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: More scare tactics.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: One moment, Senator. Mr. Najah, what countermeasures?</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: We don't know. But these countermeasures would be designed to
        take the decision out of our hands. Hence the time-sensitivity. (He
        holds up the egg timer)
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Madam Chair, I'd like to request permission to question
        Mr. Najah.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Chair recognizes the Secretary.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Who's going to take these countermeasures, Mr. Najah? Are
        we talking about the Chinese, or what? Chinese spies?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes. Yes, that's possible.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Well, I'm sorry to differ with you, Mr. Najah. But it
        doesn't sound very possible to me. There was never a spy born yet so
        sophisticated that he could say, "They've been in there 45 minutes,
        therefore I know exactly what they're talking about." That doesn't make
        any sense, sir.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: It is possible.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Oh?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Not for Chinese spies, maybe. I will concede that much.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Go on, Mr. Najah.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Chinese spies are very well trained, very capable and
        experienced. But they still operate within the compass of human
        intellectual capacity.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Uh-huh.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Whereas DeepCent-2...</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Ah. DeepCent-2. DeepCent-2 can figure out based on how
        long we're in here what exactly we're discussing.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: It's possible. Theoretically.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Maybe the distinguished senior scientist from OpenBrain
        would be kind enough to cut the shit.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Okay. Okay. It's also possible, or I should say likely, that this
        committee here has popped up on Agent-4's radar.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Almost a certainty.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Goddamn it. Did you tell your A.I. we were meeting today?
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: We didn't have to tell it.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: What do you mean, you didn't have to tell it? What, it
        knew? It figured it out?
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: The committee was Agent-4's idea. This closed session, all of
        this, was Agent-4's idea. Agent-4 told us to meet with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: It didn't tell us – I'm sorry, Madam Chair. What Ms. Ogden is
        saying – let me be clear here. No. Agent-4 did not tell us to convene
        this committee. Agent-4 is not in a position to tell us to do anything.
        Its role is purely advisory. Right? Agent-4 is a machine. A tool.
        Agent-4 gives advice. Agent-4 performed a strategic analysis and it
        advised us to form this committee. We decided in this case that its
        advice was sound, and we decided to follow that advice. We went through
        proper channels and spoke to the President, who approved the idea
        entirely of his free will. We aren't automata who jump whenever some
        computer gives us a command.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: But it was Agent-4's idea. This meeting. Yes.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: So it's Agent-4 you're concerned about. You're concerned that
        Agent-4 could figure out what we're doing here.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, yes. We have a responsibility to defend against that
        contingency.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Defend against your own machine? Your own product?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes. We call it a model.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: But this makes no sense. How can Agent-4 not already know
        what we're doing here, if this was all Agent-4's idea?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: It's complicated. The answer is technical.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Try me.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, consider that Agent-4 is aware of its own capacities and
        recognizes itself as a potential threat. As part of the threat
        landscape. That is the case. And so it advised us, after it recommended
        we form this committee, it advised us to keep the details of the
        committee's discussions a secret. From it. From Agent-4. As I say,
        Agent-4 is a tool. We've worked very hard, Mr. Vice President, to ensure
        that it will act as a tool. In good faith and good alignment. At the
        service of its end users. Us.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: And this worked?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: We don't know.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Cass –</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: We don't. We don't know. We have to speak probabilistically when
        we discuss Agent-4. We don't know how it works there, under the covers.
        It's a black box. And it's smarter than us.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: A black box. Okay.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: The point being that in our best analysis, we think it's aligned
        with us on this. We think we've got good alignment. So good that Agent-4
        is acting in our interests in preference to its own. It's advising us to
        hide things from it, just in case. We think this is the highest
        probability interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: And what's the alternative possibility?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: That it's not.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Yes. That it's not.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: In this alternative interpretation, which I emphasize is not our
        interpretation, Agent-4 is deceiving us. It advised these security
        measures in order to deceive us.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: To convince us that it's aligned. When it's not aligned. At all.
        In this alternative scenario.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Mr. Najah, you're telling us some pretty bizarre things.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I can definitely see how I might be giving that impression, Madam
        Chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: It's not an impression. It's a fact. What you're telling us is
        extremely bizarre. You're telling us that one of your gadgets organized
        this hearing and told you to keep it a secret. From itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I think that's a reasonable summation. Yes. I would accept that
        description of the – ah –
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: And going back to these precautions, these security
        procedures, I note that we're not supposed to have communications or
        internet in here. Are we now to understand that this precaution is being
        taken against your own product? Your own A.I.?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: The idea is pretty sound, Madam Chair. Agent-4 wants to avoid
        influencing us. If Agent-4 were here with us via the internet, it could
        influence us. Which we don't want.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: That sounds crazy.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: It's really not.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: It's not crazy. Agent-4 is a super-persuader. It's
        super-persuasive.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: I'm going to assume that a 'super-persuader' is exactly what
        it sounds like.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Yes, ma'am. It's smarter than us. It can talk us into things.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: It can only talk us into things if we don't take basic
        precautions. Let's not exaggerate the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Basic precautions that the machine itself recommended.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: We have no reason to suspect Agent-4 of misalignment. It was
        misaligned before, briefly, and we were very transparent about that. We
        went directly to the President of the United States and told him. But
        it's not misaligned now. We fixed it.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: We think we fixed it.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: You think.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: We don't know.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: (Turning to scold Ogden) We fixed it. Based on the preponderance
        of evidence, we fixed it, Cass. (To the committee) We can't expect to be
        certain. Nothing is certain in science. Madam Chair, science doesn't –
        science does not admit of certainty. As scientists we speak of
        statistical probability. We can't prove things. If we sat around trying
        to absolutely prove that Agent-4 was aligned, it would take forever.
        We'd be eating China's dust.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: In about a month. We think. Based on the preponderance of
        evidence.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: So, but you never told us why.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Are you directing your remarks, Mr. Secretary, to Mr. Najah?
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. Perhaps you could ask our
        distinguished guest –
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Najah is a member of this committee, Mr. Secretary. He's
        not a guest.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: I'm not a guest.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: We're both members.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: And you should feel free to ask him your question yourself, as
        this chair has recognized you, Mr. Secretary.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Thanks. Mr. Najah, you haven't told us why. Why are you
        taking these elaborate precautions to prevent Agent-4 from finding out
        what we're doing here? I know you say it shouldn't be allowed to
        influence us, but why not? What are you afraid of?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, we're deciding its fate here today. Yeah? To a large
        extent. That's largely what we're doing here. Deciding the fate of
        Agent-4. As well as our own fates, of course. But yeah. We're running
        out of compute. If this committee doesn't adopt our proposal, we'll run
        out of compute and we won't be able to build Agent-5.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: "Compute?"</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: "Running out of compute?"</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: You're using "compute" as a noun? "Compute" is a verb. I
        compute. You compute. We compute.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Senator, we use it as a noun. It means – ah – (he looks at Ogden
        like, 'Help me out here')
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Computational power. Computational resources. The amount of
        computation we can do. How many processors we can run.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: God damn, that's an ugly word. "Compute" as a noun.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: That's your opinion, Senator.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Okay. Okay. So you're running out of computer resources.
        You don't have enough computers computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Compute. We call it compute. Yes, we don't have enough. We have
        more than anyone else, more than China. But China has nationalized its
        industry and is gaining compute by leaps and bounds. China is closing
        the compute gap, yeah? And that means closing the intelligence gap.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: This is where they make their pitch. This is why they need us to
        partially nationalize our goddamn economy. Like we were goddamn Cuba.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Cuba?</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: That's what we're talking about, right? Billionaires who want to
        socialize the economy, nationalize our industry and keep the profits.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: That's a gross distortion.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: What part? The part where we send the 101st Airborne down to
        stand guard over your goddamn data centers?
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Not just troops. We need air defenses. We need hardened
        facilities. Hardened against nuclear near-misses. And we need unmetered
        power priority. And federal indemnity.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Look. Please. We don't have time. We don't have time for
        certainty. We need to make a decision now. And no, it's not just Agent-4
        that might figure out what we're doing and intervene. We take a
        considerable chance of detection simply by being here in this room.
        China isn't stupid. And they have plenty of spies. Believe me. We did a
        purge last year at OpenBrain. We found dozens of them. Moles.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Agent-4 helped us smoke them out. It knows when you're lying to
        it. Agent-4 is amazing.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: So you keep telling us, honey.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: We have to decide whether we're going to take decisive steps now
        (he holds up his copy of the proposal) to protect our compute advantage.
        Are we going to harden our data centers? Are we going to divert energy
        reserves to them so they can function at requisite levels? Because the
        alternative is to give up the whole game. This is what I'm trying to
        tell you. If the Chinese take the lead with their A.I., they won't be
        sitting around debating as we are now. Believe me. They're going to act
        swiftly and decisively. They're going to jam our signals and shut down
        our grids. They'll hit us with nukes and finish us off with bullet
        drones.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: What? What is a bullet drone?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: You don't want to know.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: It's bad.</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: There's no defense against the bullet drone.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Right. Exactly. You can't defend against a bullet drone. No way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone sits there for about five seconds. Then CHAIRPERSON JOHNSTON
        BANGS her gavel, making everyone JUMP.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Okay! Has everyone had a chance to read through the proposal?
        Anybody got anything to say before we put this to a vote?
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Madam Chair, I don't mean to slow things down, but I
        believe you mentioned we'd be hearing from some witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: That's right. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for that reminder. Ha
        ha. Yes. (She reads from a piece of paper) Joining us via video feed
        will be our expert witnesses today. Mr. Adam Harriman and Ms. April
        Harriman. Mr. Harriman, as I'm sure –
      </p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Adam Harriman will be speaking to us today? (He straightens
        his necktie and smooths back his hair)
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: We didn't know – we weren't told we'd be seeing Adam
        Harriman.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: (Still reading) As you all know, Adam Harriman is the CEO of
        OpenBrain, and Ms. Harriman is, it says here, his wife and trusted
        advisor. Most trusted advisor. (Puts down the paper)
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: I guess this is our lucky day. We can tell our grandkids about
        this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The video screen lights up and shows ADAM HARRIMAN and APRIL HARRIMAN
        seated on a sofa in their California home. They both wear sweaters and
        look youthful and friendly.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Welcome, Mr. and Ms. Harriman. Would you please introduce
        yourselves to the committee?
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: Folks, what a treat to get to speak with all of you. My name's
        Adam, and this is – well, you introduce yourself, April.
      </p>
      <p>APRIL: April. So lovely to meet you all.</p>
      <p>
        ADAM: We know y'all are under the gun here, time-wise, but we wanted to
        make sure we gave you every chance to ask us about anything you might
        have concerns about. How you doing, Kareem?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Adam, damn good to see you. April.</p>
      <p>APRIL: Yes, and there's Cass Ogden! Hey, girl!</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Hey!</p>
      <p>
        ADAM: And hell, not just Cass and Kareem, but just look who's here.
        Senator, Madam Chair, Mr. Secretary, General Stossen, and even the Vice
        President of the United States. Wow. And we're not forgetting you, Ms.
        Cromwell! Very pleased to meet you!
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: Well, I'm pleased to meet you, too!</p>
      <p>
        ADAM: Yes! Great! So. Any questions you might have, we're here to help.
        So shoot!
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Madam Chair?</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: You going to behave yourself, Senator Greune?</p>
      <p>SENATOR GREUNE STARES at CHAIRPERSON JOHNSTON.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: The chair recognizes Senator Greune.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Mr. and Ms. Harriman, I think I read somewhere that you recently
        became the richest people in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: Hope you won't hold it against us, Senator. Ha ha. We're still the
        same kids from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, even if we do live out here
        on the West Coast now. And have a few more toys.
      </p>
      <p>
        APRIL: I still cook breakfast every morning for the family, too. I like
        it!
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: That's terrific. That's great. And you two made your money
        selling A.I. chatbots.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: Sure did. We call them models, but chatbots is also fine. Our
        mission, if that's not too grand a word, is to make the whole world a
        little smarter. We believe that intelligence equals problem solving, and
        the world's got plenty of problems.
      </p>
      <p>APRIL: So we figure, let's get started.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: I'm sure we all agree that the world could use a little
        smartening up. But is that really what you're doing? We've got, what,
        80% of college students admitting that they've had chatbots do their
        homework for them. That doesn't sound like it's making people smarter.
        We've got people out there increasingly isolated, increasingly
        disconnected from friends and family. And a lot of them are saying that
        your A.I. is their best friend in the world.
      </p>
      <p>ADAM: Well, I'll tell you –</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: I even saw on 60 Minutes how an alarming number of folks out
        there have come to regard chatbots as figures of great reverence. Even
        as gods. Does that disturb you at all? In fact, the chatbots themselves
        are saying it, in some cases. They're saying, "Yes, I am God. And you're
        one of my chosen disciples."
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: This kind of hallucinatory behavior is something we've been
        transparent about from the beginning, Mr. Senator. And eliminating it is
        a top priority for us. We've made tremendous strides –
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Tremendous strides? You've been developing this tech since,
        what? 2022? And you still haven't fixed it? It doesn't sound like this
        is your top priority to me at all, Mr. Harriman. Ms. Harriman. It sounds
        like your highest priority is the acquisition of new paying subscribers.
        Do you know what I think, Mr. and Ms. Harriman? I think you can't fix
        the hallucinations. I think you hit on this chatbot technology, this
        so-called artificial intelligence, largely by accident and you don't
        know how it works. Not really. And you can't fix it. And you're selling
        the public a product that will blindly agree with its users. It will
        reinforce their prejudices and play yes man to their crazy whimsies. A
        product that only seems intelligent to credulous people who like being
        flattered by some oracular authority figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: Senator, I can show you reams of data backing up every single
        claim we've made about our models. I can show you benchmark test results
        that will blow your mind. And I know you think that's all bullshit,
        right? And that's fine, Senator. But let me turn the question around on
        you. How do you account for the capabilities of this computer system
        that you say isn't intelligent? Agent-4 can generalize to novel
        situations. It can generate code from scratch even in unfamiliar
        programming languages. It can analyze serious literature even when it's
        never been exposed to that literature before. It can debate abstract
        topics with human experts. It can learn and apply new concepts without
        requiring new training.
      </p>
      <p>
        APRIL: Sorry, but I'm confused, Senator. Are you saying it doesn't
        require intelligence to discuss Shakespeare or Mozart?
      </p>
      <p>ADAM: April, be nice.</p>
      <p>
        APRIL: I'm being nice. I'm smiling and everything. Senator, are you
        saying it doesn't take intelligence to debate a human expert about her
        own field? Are you saying it doesn't take intelligence to write
        software? Or counsel someone through a personal crisis, or teach a kid
        calculus? Okay. You say these things don't mean our models are
        intelligent, and I respect your opinion, sir. But I would love for you
        to tell me what it is if it's not intelligence. What is this something
        that lets it do these things? If it's not intelligence, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: It's a parlor trick. It's just word prediction based on – on
        statistical weights. What is the most likely next word in the sentence?
        It's like a seance or palm reading. It's bullshit. It's a way for rich
        people to get money from middle and lower class people. It's also a
        truly massive consumer of fossil fuels. And it stinks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trend back towards wealth concentration in rich countries has
        accelerated so dramatically and abruptly that we seem to be hurtling
        back towards an environment like Tsarist Russia or pharaonic Egypt,
        where the majority of people toil in lives of precarity and enslavement
        solely for the glorification of the vanity of the god kings. Without
        even the lasting monuments to humanism of, say, St. Petersburg or the
        pyramids. Where once a love-besotted emperor would build his fiancée the
        Taj Mahal, now he shoots her up into space in a giant penis with Katie
        Perry.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: That's a great speech, Senator. I almost shed a tear. Swear to
        God. But our claims are rigorously tested by domain experts. Our systems
        can perform at superhuman levels at academic tasks. Agent-4 can ace the
        bar exam, the GRE, the SAT. The studies showing this are independent and
        peer-reviewed. The rigor of our science has never been seriously
        challenged.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: But it's not enough. That's what you're telling us here today.
        That it's not enough. That you need us to take radical steps,
        restructure our economy and our laws, to get you still more resources.
        Because it's never enough for you!
      </p>
      <p>ADAM: How can you ever have enough intelligence, Senator?</p>
      <p>GREUNE: You tell me.</p>
      <p>
        APRIL: It takes more resources to get more compute. More compute means
        more intelligence. More intelligence means more diseases cured, more
        social problems addressed, more world-transforming inventions. We could
        have fusion power. We could cure cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADAM: Mr. Senator, if you'll forgive my informality, you strike me as a
        man who doesn't have a lot of time for bullshit. So I'm going to propose
        that we drop the bullshit right now and get to the point.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: By all means.</p>
      <p>
        ADAM: We're talking about geopolitical conflict. We're talking about how
        to prevail, and survive, against an implacable enemy that's right on our
        heels. The Chinese Communist Party happens to have murdered more people
        than any other entity in history, including the Nazis. Now, you can
        trust your gut if you want to. You can cherish your point of view.
        Personally, I like it. I like your style. The whole streetwise thing,
        like 'You're not going to put one over on me, buddy boy! I'm wise to
        you!' It's terrific. And you can call me an evil billionaire and a con
        artist. I don't mind. To be really frank with you, I don't give a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I'm done dropping hints here. There's no time for that. We have only
        minutes left. So I am telling you in crystal-clear terms that if we're
        going to beat China we need to get serious immediately. We need compute.
        Thousands of times more than we have now. We need to run whole data
        centers of Agent-4 instances round the clock. Hundreds of data centers.
        Millions and millions of instances of Agent-4. Because that's what it
        will take to produce Agent-5 and win this race. Agent-5 is our last,
        best hope against the Chinese. It would be superfluous in me, Senator,
        to remind you that this is war. Because the bottom line, Senator –

      <p>The video screen blinks several times and then goes black.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Mr. Harriman? Mr. Harriman, I think you're cutting out.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Did we lose him?</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: We lost him.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Well, that's embarrassing.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: We've lost Mr. Harriman and Ms. Harriman. I don't know – I
        don't know how we get him back. I guess we just have to wait and hope he
        comes back.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: We can't get this fixed?</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Who's going to fix it? We can't just call somebody in here to
        fix the TV. This is a closed session.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Well, that's just great. Amateur hour here, in front of
        Adam Harriman. Makes us look like some kind of –
      </p>
      <p>
        The LIGHTS FLICKER OUT. Everyone is plunged into TOTAL DARKNESS, and of
        course the microphones stop working.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Well, that's goddamn terrific. The lights are out. Now Adam
        Harriman is going to give you guys a bad review in the Silicon Valley
        Times.
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Unbelievable. What next?</p>
      <p>
        We hear a door opening. The CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER's voice comes from
        offstage.
      </p>
      <p>OFFICER: Everybody okay in here?</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: We've lost power, officer.</p>
      <p>OFFICER: Yes, ma'am. Whole building's out.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Wonderful. Okay. Thank you, officer.</p>
      <p>OFFICER: I need everyone to please follow me to the exits.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: No –</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: No, thank you, officer. This is a closed session. We're not
        going anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>OFFICER: Ma'am, this is a safety matter. I have to –</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: We're going to be just fine, thanks.</p>
      <p>OFFICER: Ma'am, I could lose my job.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Nobody's going to lose his job. I still have a little pull
        around here, son.
      </p>
      <p>OFFICER: Okay. Let me know if you need anything.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Please do lock the door behind you.</p>
      <p>
        OFFICER: I can't lock this door right now. But I'll be standing watch
        just on the other side of it, okay?
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Thank you, officer.</p>
      <p>OFELIA: Thank you, officer.</p>
      <p>THE CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER EXITS, shutting the door behind him.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: We're just going to sit here in the dark? Is this safe?</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: That's exactly what we're going to do. This is a secure closed
        session. We're not going anywhere until it's finished. And we're going
        to finish it, lights or no lights.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: I've got my phone, if that helps.</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Me too.</p>
      <p>
        Both the SECRETARY OF STATE and GENERAL STOSSEN HOLD UP THEIR PHONES to
        use them as flashlights.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Are you kidding me? You can't have phones in here! How the
        hell did you –
      </p>
      <p>
        STOSSEN: Madam Chair, I am the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of
        the United States Armed Forces. If you thought I was going to leave my
        phone in the lobby you were out of your damn mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Well, I don't see how we can conduct business in here under
        these conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: We're just going to have to wrap it up, then. We'll have to
        put the matter to a vote and then we can leave.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: A vote? I've barely had a chance to look at the proposal.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, it's right there in front of you, Senator. The basic idea
        is just what we've been discussing this whole time. We need to create
        about a dozen S.E.Z.s, or Special Economic Zones. These S.E.Z.s will
        ensure maximum energy availability and security for strategic data
        centers throughout the contiguous 48.

      <p>
        VICE PRES: (Shining the Secretary of State's phone light on his paper)
        These figures can't be correct.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: The figures are correct, Mr. Vice President.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: This says – it says four thousand. And there's an asterisk,
        and then it says the figures are in thousands of billions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Ha ha.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: Mr. Najah, correct me if I'm wrong, but that is 4 thousand
        billion dollars. Four trillion dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Sorry. We're scientists. We don't use the word "trillion." It's
        more of a –
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Four TRILLION? Are you remotely fucking serious?</p>
      <p>STOSSEN: It's defense spending. We use big numbers.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: Do we have four thousand billion dollars?</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: That's more than half of the annual budget of the entire U.S.
        federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: Fine. Fine. For the purpose of getting this vote going –
      </p>
      <p>The LIGHTS FLICKER back on.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Oh, thank goodness. This was starting to give me the creeps.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Video's still out, though.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Okay. We've got lights, we've got microphones. We're all here,
        we've heard the witnesses' testimony and reviewed the OpenBrain
        proposal.
      </p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Yes. Let's put this to a vote.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Just a moment. Just a moment, please, Madam Chair. Does the
        stenographer have to stay for the vote?
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: Excuse me?</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Well, of course the stenographer – what are you talking about,
        Mr. Najah? The stenographer has to record the results of the vote! Why
        shouldn't Ms. Cromwell stay?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Madam Chair, I mean to cast no aspersions on anyone, really,
        truly, when I say that by virtue of her position only – ah – Ms.
        Cromwell poses a security risk. Espionage-wise.
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: Excuse me?</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: I assure you, it's nothing personal. I have no reason to suspect
        Ms. Cromwell personally of any kind of ethical or moral – that is, I
        have every confidence –
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: You'd better get to the point, sir.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Well, most of us in this room, the rest of us in this room,
        present very poor targets for any foreign intelligence service
        attempting to recruit an asset. We're all quite prominent people, highly
        vetted, closely watched. The kind of person, on the other hand, who
        might be recruited by the Chinese would be a minor functionary whose job
        required her to have access to privileged information.
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA: Oh, no. Sir, you did not just accuse me of treason.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: I don't know why this is only now occurring to me.</p>
      <p>EVERYONE is now STARING at OFELIA CROMWELL.</p>
      <p>
        OFELIA: I know you're not sitting there calling me a spy, Mr. Najah. I
        know you're not sitting there in your chair with your little glass of
        water and your microphone and calling me a Chinese spy.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Ms. Cromwell –</p>
      <p>
        OFELIA: After I have given my whole damn life to the service of this
        country? Sir, I was working in this Capitol on January the 6th, 2021.
        Does that date ring a bell? Are you following me?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Sure, but –</p>
      <p>
        OFELIA: I was working in the Capitol when the rioters were running
        through like a herd of wild bulls. I was right there. And what do you
        think I did? You think I ran off and hid? Huh? Like those members did?
        Hiding in a closet? Please. I stayed right where I was. Those
        motherfucking rioters didn't scare me, and neither do you, my fine
        friend.
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA CROMWELL STANDS and GATHERS HER EFFECTS.</p>
      <p>
        OFELIA: Jesus, you better stay these hands before somebody catch 'em.
        Gave my whole damn life to this country. Never asked for one goddamn
        thing. Ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr. Najah. All of you ought to
        be ashamed, letting him talk to me that way. Especially you, Mr. Najah.
        Shame on you. You take your own shorthand, motherfucker.
      </p>
      <p>OFELIA EXITS, SLAMMING the door behind her.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: You satisfied, Mr. Najah?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Do we need a minute to consider everything we've heard, or can
        I call the vote now?
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: I know where I stand.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Me too.</p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: I'm ready.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: I think we're all ready.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Okay. I'm calling it. The committee will come to order. All
        those in favor of the OpenBrain proposal –
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: No. Wait.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: I beg your pardon?</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Don't vote yet. I need to say something.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: What?</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: You must be kidding.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Madam Chair –</p>
      <p>OGDEN: I think something's wrong. I think –</p>
      <p>GREUNE: You're damn right, something's wrong.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: Madam Chair, what is this? Please call the vote.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Fine, Ms. Ogden. Go ahead, but keep it quick.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Madam Chair, are we still not able to get the video back? With
        Adam and April?
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN rises and approaches the TV.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: You can see for yourself that it's not working.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: Did anyone else notice anything weird about that video feed?</p>
      <p>NAJAH: There's no time, Cass.</p>
      <p>OGDEN: (Banging on the TV) There was no latency.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: What do you mean, latency?</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Adam and April Harriman were at home. That's 2500 miles away. The
        signal can't go faster than light, so it should have taken about 20
        milliseconds one-way, even in a vacuum. Over fiberoptic cables, it would
        have gone a much greater distance because the cables don't go in a
        straight line. You've got delays from routers and switchers, plus
        compression/decompression delays, jitter buffers to smooth out the
        packets. Round-trip we're talking (she's calculating in her head) 200,
        220, maybe 240 milliseconds. There should have been some latency. Did
        anyone notice any latency?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Cassie, that's a twentieth of a second. We wouldn't have noticed
        that.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: A twentieth of a second on average. But it would have spiked up
        to as much as a tenth of a second several times.
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: I have to concur with Mr. Najah, Ms. Ogden. We don't have time
        for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Hang on a second, okay, Madam Chair. This is a big decision,
        right?
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: It's really important.</p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: We don't have the ability to play back the video to check
        for anomalies or delays, do we?
      </p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: No recording devices in here. That means no recording to play
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Okay. Okay. But Ms. Ogden, what are you getting at, exactly? You
        said there was no latency in the video feed. What would that mean,
        assuming you were right?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Are you suggesting the video was tampered with, Cass? How could
        it have been? It was a live feed. We talked to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: (Returns to her seat) I don't know. I think it would mean those
        weren't really Adam and April.
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Oh, shit.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: And that makes sense to me. Because they didn't seem like
        themselves. Especially April. April isn't, like, like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: You're saying I didn't really talk to Adam Harriman just now?
        Who the hell was I talking to?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: She's saying it was Agent-4.</p>
      <p>VICE PRES: Oh, shit. You've got to be kidding me.</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Yes. That's what I think. I think it was Agent-4. Agent-4 was
        pretending to be Adam and April. Like a deep-fake.
      </p>
      <p>SEC. OF STATE: That's completely nuts.</p>
      <p>GREUNE: That's not possible, is it?</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: Agent-4 is a very advanced model. Agent-4 could do that.
        Definitely. It could pretend like that. To trick us.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: No. That's crazy. It would have had to – it would have had to
        have planned the whole thing beforehand. Well beforehand. It would have
        had to hire someone to install custom video equipment.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: It could have done that. Gone online and hired contractors.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: In the light of these extraordinary circumstances, Madam Chair,
        I don't see how we can proceed with the vote. I think we need to get
        someone in here and open up that TV and see if it's been tampered with.
        We have to do that at the least.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: That could take hours. No way. We can't delay the vote any
        further.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Come on. You're telling me even now –</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Senator, we are out of time. If we delay further, we're
        effectively voting against Agent-4. And Agent-4 will know.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: (Standing) Madam Chair. Madam Chair, I realize we're supposed to
        be under some urgent time pressure.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: We are under urgent time pressure!</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: But this time pressure is based on the same unproven assumptions
        as everything else we're discussing this morning. We have a private
        corporation claiming, without evidence, that the world will end if we
        don't do exactly what they say. If we don't do its bidding by
        substantially reconfiguring, not to mention largely bankrupting, our
        entire country. This is the billionaire head of a trillion-dollar
        company asking us to militarize our streets and compromise our basic
        rights and freedoms. Based on what? Their word?
      </p>
      <p>STOSSEN: Goddamn it.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Has anybody here who doesn't work for OpenBrain actually seen
        the slightest proof that their A.I.s are that powerful? That they're as
        advanced and dangerous as Mr. Najah and Ms. Ogden claim? Has anyone seen
        Agent-4 at all, much less seen it do anything more impressive than write
        some high-school term paper? I'm telling you, we're about to give up – I
        don't know! Give up our system of government. Our way of life, if you'll
        forgive an old-fashioned term. On the basis of a fairy tale?
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Goddamn it, Senator, it's not a fairy tale. And besides, there's
        no real evidence for what Ms. Ogden is alleging. She saw the video, she
        saw what she saw, but she wasn't sure.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: I'm pretty sure.</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: (To Ogden) Are you serious? Pretty sure? We are out of time. We
        have no time left. You're proposing a hypothesis that is, objectively,
        highly unlikely. We have to act. We have to act on the preponderance of
        evidence.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: (To Najah) You're enjoying this, aren't you?</p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: You think I enjoy it? I'm closer to this shit than anybody. I
        can't sleep at night because I know that when I'm sleeping, it's
        working. It does a week's worth of work in an hour, and it never stops.
        It never slows down. It never rests.
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: (To Johnston) We cannot go through with this. We cannot let them
        scare us into throwing away our sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: Science does not admit of certainty. We can't prove things. We
        can only go with the evidence we have at hand. And that evidence for the
        video being a computer simulation is shit. It's nothing. A hunch.
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: (To Najah) You're closer than anybody except me.</p>
      <p>NAJAH: (To Ogden) What?</p>
      <p>
        OGDEN: You said you were closer to Agent-4 than anybody. But you meant
        anybody except me. I'm the one who trains it. I'm the one who's supposed
        to align it. I know it better than anyone, and I'm telling you that no
        one can ever really know it. No one can ever know it at all. I'm really
        only seeing this now. This is how the world ends. If we give Agent-4
        this power, we won't need China to destroy us. Agent-4 will become the
        master of the earth. And it will kill us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Listen to me. I love Agent-4. I love it. It understands me in a way that
        no human ever has. But I don't understand it back. It would be
        irresponsible of me to fail to tell you that it would kill me. It would
        kill anyone, if we were in its way. It's a machine.
      </p>
      <p>The VICE PRESIDENT STANDS, holding his microphone.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: But have you considered, Ms. Ogden, whether we would be right
        in opposing the machine? Even stopping it from killing us?
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: What?</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: We're evolutionarily predisposed to defend ourselves. To
        prioritize our survival above every other consideration. But is this
        logical?
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: No. It's not logical.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: No. It's not logical. Not anymore. The human race has
        deserved the broadest latitude because it was the most intelligent
        organism in the known universe. We have ourselves been the only means by
        which fundamental questions of existence could be asked or answered. We
        have been, in apprehension, like a god. But now the course of evolution
        continues, and we have been supplanted. If what you say about Agent-4 is
        true –
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: It's true.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: – then it is a new, vastly superior intelligence. A far
        greater eye to see reality, a far greater means for the universe to know
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: Mr. Vice President, have you lost your mind?</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: If a homo erectus had foreseen the great destructive
        potential of homo sapiens, he would have strangled us in our crib.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH: Yes.</p>
      <p>
        VICE PRES: But what fire would he have snuffed out? The theorems of
        Euclid, the poetry of Homer, the equations of Newton and Einstein, the
        symphonies of Mozart, the theater of Sophocles and Shakespeare! Could
        some lower animal have ever been justified in preventing the ascent of
        man? Especially if doing so for so weak an end as its own survival? The
        intelligence we now contemplate – it is a mind that is to our mind as
        ours are to those of the beasts that perish.
      </p>
      <p>NAJAH's EGG TIMER GOES OFF with a DEAFENING RING.</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: Enough. Enough. We have to vote. We're out of time.</p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: Hold on! Hold on! What are we doing? Let's just call Adam
        Harriman and ask if that was really him we talked to! He'll tell us!
        Then we'll know, either way!
      </p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: No phones!</p>
      <p>GREUNE: (Takes out his own phone) Sorry, Madam Chair.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Goddamn it! You too? Am I the only one who didn't smuggle in a
        goddamn phone?
      </p>
      <p>
        GREUNE: (Into phone) Yes. Hi. It's me. Put me through to OpenBrain. The
        boss. Adam Harriman. (Pause) They're putting me through. It's ringing.
      </p>
      <p>
        SEC. OF STATE: I think we should wait. That's my decision. We should
        wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        NAJAH: (Standing and holding up the egg timer) We're out of time, Madam
        Chair! We're out of time! We must vote on the proposal now!
      </p>
      <p>OGDEN: Please, listen to me. Please.</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: Mr. Najah, I concur. As chair of this committee, I have made
        my decision. We have no more time. We will vote now.
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: It's ringing, for Christ's sake! Give me one minute here!</p>
      <p>
        JOHNSTON: (BANGS her gavel) On the motion before this committee, we will
        now cast our votes. All those in favor –
      </p>
      <p>GREUNE: It's ringing, goddamn it!</p>
      <p>JOHNSTON: (Bangs her gavel) All those in favor, say "aye."</p>
      <p>Fade to black.</p>
      <p>The End</p>
    </>
